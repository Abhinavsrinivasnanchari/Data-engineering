## 🔧 What is Data Engineering?

**Data Engineering** is the practice of designing, building, and maintaining reliable systems for collecting, transforming, and storing data. It is the foundation of any data-driven organization.

### 🎯 Key Responsibilities
- Build and manage **ETL/ELT pipelines**
- Design **data warehouses** and **data lakes**
- Ensure **data quality, consistency, and availability**
- Work with **large-scale data** using distributed systems
- Collaborate with **data scientists, analysts, and software engineers**

## 🧠 How It Differs from Other Tech Fields

| Field | Description | Tools/Skills | Connection to DE |
|-------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Data Engineering** | Builds data pipelines and infrastructure | SQL, Python, Spark, Airflow | Core |
| **Data Science** | Extracts insights and models from data | Python, ML, Stats | Uses DE output |
| **Software Engineering** | Builds web/mobile apps & APIs | Java, Python, Git | May integrate with data |
| **DevOps / Cloud Eng.** | Automates deployment and infra | Docker, AWS, CI/CD | Supports pipeline deployment |
| **Analytics / BI** | Creates dashboards and reports | SQL, Tableau, Power BI | Consumes curated data |
| **ML Engineering** | Deploys machine learning models | TensorFlow, MLFlow, Python | Needs clean data from DE |

## 🧱 Core Concepts in Data Engineering

### 🔁 ETL/ELT
- **ETL**: Extract → Transform → Load
- **ELT**: Extract → Load → Transform (common in cloud platforms)

### 🏗️ Data Pipelines
- Automated workflows that prepare data for analysis
- Tools: **Apache Airflow, Prefect, Luigi**

### 🗃️ Data Warehousing
- Centralized repositories of cleaned, structured data
- Examples: **Snowflake, BigQuery, Amazon Redshift**

### ☁️ Cloud Platforms
- Used for scalable storage and processing
- Examples: **AWS, GCP, Azure**
